<!-- Hey, I'm **Trevor**! A self-taught software engineer from California.

Right around the time I graduated college with my Business degree, I certified as a Google Cloud Platform Architect & Engineer, but _I felt stuck_ afterword because I wanted to build full stack applications and I realized I needed to learn UX/UI.

I decided it was **time for a change** so I started to learn `<JavaScript/>` whenever I had free time. I quickly started to love it and I’ve been studying Frontend Development ever since!

Over the last couple of years, I've taken _hundreds of hours_ of online courses like...

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) from the University of Helsinki
- [Svelte Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svelte/) from Rich Harris
- [The Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele
- [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) by Brad Traversy
- [Complete React Developer in 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) by Zero To Mastery
- [ES6 JavaScript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-es6-tutorial/) by Stephen Grider

...and read [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/) by David Flanagan.

Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I've also done a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses. You can check them out over at my [website](http://trevorbehnke.com/portfolio). Sometimes I also post about programming related topics in my blog.

Socrates once said...

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

...and in that sense I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations as well as stay in touch with the latest technology and strategies. -->
